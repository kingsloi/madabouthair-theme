## About Paper

Paper is the default appearance of [Canvas](https://github.com/cnvs/canvas). Feel free to fork it, use it as a starting point and create your own theme! For more information regarding themes in general, check out the [Canvas documentation](https://cnvs.readme.io/docs/theme-overview).

## Installation

Since Paper is integrated into Canvas as the default appearance out of the box, this isn't a theme that you need to install. This repository is meant to be a guide for creating new themes.

## License

Paper is an open-sourced theme library licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
